<h3>Storyboard Description.</h3>

<h2>Shots</h2>
    <h3>Shot 1:</h3>
    <ol = type = "A">
      <li>Type</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Tracking Shot- Even the name of the shot is symbolic. This opening shot should be moderately confusing. Only in the end/middle, without reading the story beforehand, will the story come together and completely make sense. This sense of mystery for the viewer represents how the protagonist is not sure if he likes the path he is taking.</li>
          <li>**The shot that is currently being displayed is only the opening shot of a part of the movie. Later on, there will be a shot of him at an identical time. Instead of being dressed formally, he will be in street clothes and have a much different job.</li>
        </ul>  
      <li>Movement</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The camera's movement is very important here. It is obvious that the camera is being held without a tripod. Although there is not intentional shakicam going on, the camera is moving like a head would when someone is walking. This represents how the protagonist feels like someone is standing over his shoulder, watching his every move.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Sound</li>
        <ul>
          <li>We will figure this out in the end.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Dialogue</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Here, the narrator will be speaking to give an overview of his life in the business world. His current situation will be described and he will mention his history since the point in time where he chose the legal path instead of the drug dealer side. At this point, the audience still doesn't know that there are two choices.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
  
    <h3>Shot 2:</h3>
    <ol = type = "A">
      <li>Type</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Close up- the phone is a very important part of the protagonist's life. He uses it both in the good world and the bad world. This phone is a symbol of the communication he has in both lives. In other words, he is  never trying to figure something out for himself. In both cases, he has an employer. This provides continuity between the two lives and removes variables between the two lives.</li>
        </ul>  
      <li>Movement</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The camera does not move in this shot. It is zoomed and focused in a seemingly arbitrary location. As the shot continues, the protagonist walks into view and takes out his phone. Only the phone is in focus when he takes it out.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Sound</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The shot changes before we can see who it is, but the phone ring is audible. In the good world, he has a very normal ringtone to represent how normal his life is. He has a consistent job and a clear path.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Dialogue</li>
        <ul>
          <li>There is not any dialogue in this shot, only his ringtone can be heard.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
  
    <h3>Shot 3:</h3>
    <ol = type = "A">
      <li>Type</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Medium shot- At this point, he has pulled out his phone and the caller ID is shown. This is very important to the film. The good business man is not afraid of people knowing who he is and does not block his number. In the same shot in the other world, the number comes up as blocked. This represents how shady that life is.</li>
        </ul>  
      <li>Movement</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Although there isn't any symbolism in the motion, the camera moves from the </li>
